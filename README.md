# Requirements:

* Python 3.8 or newer - https://www.python.org/downloads/

# How to use

run `python build.py`

This will produce `install` directory in your build folder. You need to copy it into your toolchain as `SDK` subfolder.

Copy, tweak and include `usage` directory in your project.
